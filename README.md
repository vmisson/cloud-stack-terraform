This is the Terraform code of my own application stack based on Azure Cloud. 
The application deployed by Terraform are managed in this github repo : https://github.com/vmisson/cloud-stack-docker

This infrastructure cost arround 1,37â‚¬ per day (North Europe). For this price you will have :

- RSS aggregator

Auto-update, management, HTTPS and moniroting are included for all those services.

### Installing

You will have to clone the repo and instantiate the different infrastructure part one by one in the correct order.
By default the infrastructure will be deployed in North Europe but it can be changed in varaibles.tf file.
